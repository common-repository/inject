Control WordPress Dynamic Content

== Description ==

**Inject** is a very special WordPress plugin. It was developed to give WordPress users **more control** over their contents in an elegant way.  
In WordPress, if you want to show things in an original way, you can write custom page template, use great user friendly plugins or widgets. If you're not a web developer, writing a PHP template can be a little tricky. If you use plugins or widgets, you have to adapt yourself to it, and most of time you are limited or frustated by a lack of customization. 

**Important note : the creation of the Inject model requires some skills in Twig, HTML, CSS and Javascript.**

For more information, watch [Inject Demo Video](http://cut.lu/inject/video) or our [Plugin Demo Site](http://cut.lu/inject/demo).

A few conversations excerpt we had with clients: 

*the client* : I want to display a small menu to access child pages, but I don't want to update it every day !  
*us* : It could be possible. But was it planned :-/ in our brief ? (*Sometimes clients just don't want to spend another penny on that sort of functionality*).

*the client* : Why my pdfs are not automatically accessible on my page !  
*us* : Because it's not magic and you have to include it manually in your content.

*the client* : I want to display in this page a list of the lastest posts from "movies" category !  
*us* : You can put a link in the page to go to the category page "movies".

It shows that each websites are different, each customers are different and that WordPress is great, but can't do every thing we want by default.  
The **Inject Plugin** was created to reduce this lack of flexibility !

= Inject principles =

Inject relays on [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/), an easy to use [template engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_engine_\(web\)) (*that dispense to work with PHP*) and common WordPress functions which allow to query your WordPress content. 

The principles :

1. Write a template using Inject *- how my data will be displayed*
2. Generate the shortcode *- which information I want to display*
3. Insert the shortcode *- where I put my new dynamic content*

Here, a non-exhaustive list of what you can do with **Inject Plugin** :

- display a list of posts as a slider, as a simple list of title, excerpt and thumbnail, as a gallery...
- make a navigation of top-level pages, or recurrent sub-menu on pages
- display a gallery, slider of images linked to a post
- display a box with pdf documents or zip files linked to a post
- ...

= Who can use Inject Plugin =

On a *small website*, The Inject Plugin speeds up the creation of custom elements and allows you to add functionalities without increasing the final price.  
On a *big website*, with lots of content, you spend more time on custom page template, widgets or modules but thanks to  **The Inject Plugin**, you will have even more flexibility.

In **The Inject Plugin**, there is two parts which **demand minimum skills** :

So it's more destined to web developers or integrators, but you can still make really great things with Inject with a minimum knowledge.  
- *Adding the Inject shortcode*, displaying custom content doesn't required any further skills and can be used by **anyone**.
